# 🐞  Null / Weak Password Acceptance

---

## 📖 Description  
The application accepts **null, whitespace-only, or weak passwords** (e.g., `" "`, `"123"`, `"password"`).  
This undermines authentication security and allows attackers to compromise accounts with trivial guessing.  

---

## ⚡ Steps to Reproduce  
1️⃣ Navigate to **signup/registration page**.  
2️⃣ Enter a valid username/email but set password as:  
   - `" "` (space)  
   - `"a"`  
   - `"123"`  
3️⃣ Submit the form → account creation succeeds.  
4️⃣ Attempt login with the same credentials → authentication works.  
5️⃣ Repeat for **password reset/change flows** → weak password is accepted again.

---

## 🎯 Impact  
- 🔓 **Account compromise** via brute force or simple guessing.  
- 👥 Enables attackers to target reused/weak credentials.  
- 🏦 High risk for **account takeover, fraud, and privilege abuse**.  
- 📈 **Severity: High** (direct authentication weakness).

---

## 🛠️ Recommendation  
- 🚫 Reject null/whitespace-only or trivial passwords.  
- ✅ Enforce **server-side password policy**:  
  - Minimum length (≥ 8–12 chars).  
  - Require complexity (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols).  
  - Disallow **common/compromised passwords** using a blocklist (e.g., HaveIBeenPwned list).  
- 🔐 Use strong hashing (Argon2, bcrypt, PBKDF2) with proper salting.  
- 🖥️ Provide **client-side feedback** for UX but enforce validation on the server.  
- 📊 Add monitoring for repeated weak-password signup attempts.

## 📝 Summary  
The app accepts **null/weak passwords**, leading to a **critical authentication flaw**.  
Fix by enforcing **strict password policies**, using **secure hashing**, and ensuring both **signup** and **password reset flows** validate input properly.
