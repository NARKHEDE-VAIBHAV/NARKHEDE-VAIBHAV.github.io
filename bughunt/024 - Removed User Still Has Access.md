# 🐞 Removed User Still Has Access (Broken Auth)

**Severity:** 🔴 Critical (authorization bypass / privilege retention)  
**Affected Components:** Authorization, role assignment, session lifecycle, permission caching

---

## 📖 Description  
When a user is **removed from a group or role**, their access is **not immediately revoked**.  
Due to stale session tokens or cached permissions, the user may continue performing **privileged actions** without re-authentication.  
This creates a **critical authorization gap**.

---

## ⚡ Steps to Reproduce  
1️⃣ Admin removes a user from a privileged group or revokes specific roles.  
2️⃣ Without logging out, the removed user attempts to access **privileged actions or endpoints**.  
3️⃣ Observe that the user **still succeeds** in performing restricted operations.  

**Evidence:**  
- Logs showing privileged actions executed post-removal.  
- Screenshots or request traces demonstrating missing permission enforcement.

---

## 🎯 Impact  
- 🔓 **Authorization bypass:** users retain access after removal.  
- 🛡️ **Privilege escalation risk:** can manipulate data or system features unauthorized.  
- 📈 **Severity:** Critical immediate mitigation required.  
- 🧾 **Audit/logging failures:** permission checks do not enforce revocation immediately.

---

## 🛠️ Recommendation (Mitigation & Remediation)  
- 🔒 **Enforce server-side permission checks** on every action, not just at login.  
- 🔄 **Invalidate or refresh session tokens** whenever role/group assignments change.  
- ⏱️ **Reduce permission caching duration** or implement immediate revocation mechanisms.  
- 🧪 **Automated tests** to verify access revocation upon role removal.  
- 🧾 **Audit all privileged actions** to ensure no unauthorized access occurs after removal.

---

## 📝 Summary  
Users removed from roles/groups may retain access due to **stale sessions or cached permissions**.  
Mitigation requires **server-side enforcement, session invalidation, and immediate permission revocation** to maintain proper authorization controls.
