# 🐞 OTP / Login Bypass via Request Manipulation

**Severity:** 🔴 Critical (authentication bypass / account takeover)  
**Affected Components:** OTP verification service, login endpoints, authentication flows

---

## 📖 Description  
The server **trusts client-supplied verification flags** or fails to properly validate OTPs server-side.  
Attackers can **manipulate or replay requests** to bypass OTP checks, gaining unauthorized access to accounts.

---

## ⚡ Steps to Reproduce  
1️⃣ Intercept the **OTP verification request/response** using a proxy (e.g., Burp Suite).  
2️⃣ Modify critical fields in the request/response payload, e.g.:  
```
json
"status": "false" → "true"
```

3️⃣ Replay the modified request to the server.
4️⃣ Observe that access is granted without a valid OTP.

Evidence: successful authentication using tampered client payload, server logs accepting client-side verification flags without re-check.

---

🎯 Impact

🔓 Full account takeover without valid OTP.

🔁 Bypass of multi-factor authentication security.

🕵️ Sensitive user data and functionality can be accessed maliciously.

📈 Severity: Critical immediate fix required.

🛠️ Recommendation (Mitigation & Remediation)

🔒 Perform all OTP checks server-side; never trust client-supplied verification status.

🗝️ Use single-use, cryptographically secure OTP tokens stored and verified on the server.

⏱️ Implement short token TTL for OTPs to limit attack window.

📊 Rate-limit OTP attempts and detect suspicious behavior (multiple failed attempts).

🧾 Log all OTP attempts for audit and anomaly detection.

🧪 Include automated tests to ensure server-side validation cannot be bypassed by client manipulation.

---

📝 Summary

The server currently accepts client-side OTP verification flags, allowing attackers to bypass authentication.

Mitigation requires server-side validation, single-use cryptographic tokens, rate-limiting, and logging to ensure secure OTP verification.
