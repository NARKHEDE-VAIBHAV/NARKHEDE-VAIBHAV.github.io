# 🐞 Firebase Misconfiguration & Data Exposure

**Severity:** 🔴 High (data exposure / unauthorized access)  
**Affected Components:** Firebase Realtime Database, Cloud Storage, Cloud Functions, client configurations

---

## 📖 Description  
Firebase projects with **permissive security rules** can allow **unauthenticated users** to read or write sensitive data.  
This may lead to:  
- Exposure of user or application data  
- Unauthorized modifications to the database or storage  
- Abuse of functions or application logic  

---

## ⚡ Steps to Reproduce  
1️⃣ Locate the **Firebase project URL** in application config, source code, or decompiled resources.  
2️⃣ Access the database endpoint publicly : https://<project>.firebaseio.com/.json

3️⃣ Observe whether data is publicly readable or writable.  
4️⃣ Optionally, attempt safe writes (only in authorized testing) to confirm permissions.

**Evidence:**  
- JSON dump of DB content showing sensitive data  
- Ability to write or modify publicly accessible resources  
- Screenshots or logs confirming misconfigured rules

---

## 🎯 Impact  
- 🔓 **Data leakage:** user information, configs, or secrets exposed  
- ✏️ **Unauthorized writes:** attacker can modify database or storage content  
- ⚡ **Application integrity risk:** functions or logic abused via open access  
- 📈 **Severity:** High sensitive data exposure possible

---

## 🛠️ Recommendation (Mitigation & Remediation)  
- 🔒 Define **Firebase security rules** requiring `auth != null` and role-based access for read/write operations.  
- 🚫 Remove **sensitive credentials** from client applications and rotate keys if leaked.  
- 🧩 Apply **least privilege** principles for each service (DB, Storage, Functions).  
- 🔄 Use **separate projects for production and development** to isolate sensitive data.  
- 🧪 Periodically **audit Firebase rules** and test endpoints for unauthorized access.

---

## 📝 Summary  
Misconfigured Firebase projects with permissive rules expose **sensitive data and allow unauthorized writes**.  
Mitigation requires **proper security rules, credential management, and role-based access control**.
