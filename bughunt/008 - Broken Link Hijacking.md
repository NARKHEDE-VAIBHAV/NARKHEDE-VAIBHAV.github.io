# 🐞 Broken Link Hijacking

---

## 📖 Description  
The application contains **external links to unclaimed or inactive resources** (e.g., social media handles, GitHub repos).  
An attacker can **register these accounts** and gain control over the content users are redirected to, leading to reputational damage and malicious content injection.  

---

## ⚡ Steps to Reproduce  
1️⃣ Scan the website for external links (profiles, badges, footer, content pages).  
2️⃣ Test each link look for `404 Not Found` or inactive accounts.  
   - Example:  
     ```
     https://twitter.com/unused_handle
     https://github.com/deadproject123
     ```  
3️⃣ Check availability on the third-party platform.  
4️⃣ Register the unclaimed handle/repo.  
5️⃣ Verify that the target site now **points to attacker-controlled content**.  

---

## 🔧 Tools  
- 🌐 **Broken Link Checker** browser extensions.  
- 🖥️ Command-line: `wget`, `curl` (to detect 404s).  
- 🔍 Custom scripts for link scraping and validation.  

---

## 🎯 Impact  
- 🕵️ **Phishing / impersonation** - attacker can pose as the organization.  
- 💉 **Malware hosting** - attacker-controlled pages may deliver malicious content.  
- 💔 **Reputation damage** - users lose trust when official links go to harmful or irrelevant destinations.  
- 📈 **Severity: Medium** (can escalate based on the nature of the hijacked platform).  

---

## 🛠️ Recommendation  
- 🔄 **Regularly scan** for broken or dead external links.  
- 🗑️ Remove or replace links that point to inactive resources.  
- 📝 Use **descriptive placeholders** (e.g., “Account not available”) instead of linking to non-existent pages.  
- 📡 Implement **monitoring/alerts** for outbound link health.  
- 🤝 Prefer official verified accounts with long-term control.  

---

## 📝 Summary  
The site includes **broken external links** that can be hijacked by attackers registering unused handles.  
Fix by **removing dead links, scanning regularly, and monitoring external dependencies** to prevent hijacking and misuse.
