# 🛡️ Infrastructure & Attack‑Surface OSINT
**Intro:**  
Infrastructure and attack-surface OSINT tools help **identify exposed systems, discover digital assets, and understand potential attack vectors**. These platforms are widely used in cybersecurity, threat intelligence, and penetration testing to map the online footprint of organizations.
