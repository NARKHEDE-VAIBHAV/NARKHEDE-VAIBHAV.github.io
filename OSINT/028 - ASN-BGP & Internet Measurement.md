# 🌐 ASN/BGP & Internet Measurement 

**Intro:**  
ASN (Autonomous System Number) and BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) analysis is crucial for understanding **internet routing, network ownership, and global connectivity**. OSINT investigators and network analysts use these tools to map networks, verify routing policies, and detect anomalies.
