# 🌉 Bridge Monitoring

**Intro:**  
Blockchain bridges allow assets to move between different chains, but they also introduce risks. Monitoring these bridges is essential for security researchers, investigators, and traders to detect anomalies, track cross-chain transfers, and assess risks. These tools help you keep an eye on bridge transactions and their vulnerabilities.
