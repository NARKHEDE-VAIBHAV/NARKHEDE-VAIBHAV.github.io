# 🖥️ Computer Basics, Web Servers & Networking

## 💻 Computer Hardware vs Software
A **computer** consists of two main parts:  

### ⚙️ Hardware
- The **physical components** of a computer.  
- Examples:  
  - 🧠 CPU (Processor) – brain of the computer  
  - 💾 RAM – temporary memory  
  - 📀 HDD/SSD – permanent storage  
  - 🎨 GPU – graphics processing  
  - ⌨️ Keyboard, 🖱️ Mouse, 🖥️ Monitor – input/output devices  

### 🧩 Software
- The **set of instructions/programs** that tell hardware what to do.  
- Examples:  
  - 🖥️ Operating System (Windows, Linux, macOS)  
  - 🌐 Web Browser (Chrome, Firefox)  
  - 📊 Applications (MS Office, Photoshop, etc.)  
  - ⚡ Utilities (Antivirus, Drivers, Backup tools)

## 🧠 Components of a Computer
1. 🧠 **CPU (Central Processing Unit)** → Executes instructions.  
2. 💾 **RAM (Memory)** → Fast, temporary storage.  
3. 📀 **Storage** → HDD/SSD for permanent data.  
4. 🔌 **Motherboard** → Connects all components.  
5. 🔋 **Power Supply** → Provides electrical power.  
6. 🎨 **GPU (Graphics Card)** → Handles visuals & rendering.  
7. ⌨️🖱️ **Input Devices** → Keyboard, Mouse, Scanner.  
8. 🖥️ **Output Devices** → Monitor, Printer, Speakers.

## 🌐 Components of a Web Server
A **web server** is a system that hosts and delivers websites.  

- 🖥️ **Hardware** → Physical server machine.  
- ⚙️ **Operating System** → Linux (Ubuntu, CentOS) or Windows Server.  
- 🌍 **Web Server Software** → Apache, Nginx, IIS.  
- 🛢️ **Database** → MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB.  
- 💻 **Application Layer** → PHP, Python (Flask/Django), Node.js.  
- 🔒 **Security Tools** → SSL/TLS certificates, firewalls, IDS/IPS.

## 🖧 Networking Devices
Networking is powered by different devices that connect and manage traffic:  

- 🖥️ **End Devices (Hosts)** → Computers, laptops, servers.  
- 🔀 **Switch** → Connects devices inside a LAN, forwards data based on **MAC addresses**.  
- 📡 **Router** → Connects different networks (LAN ↔ Internet), forwards data using **IP addresses**.  
- 🔌 **Hub** → Simple device, sends data to all connected devices (less secure).  
- 🛡️ **Firewall** → Monitors & filters network traffic for security.  
- 📡 **Access Point (AP)** → Provides Wi-Fi connectivity to wireless devices.  
- 🌍 **Modem** → Connects your local network to the ISP (Internet Service Provider).  
- 🔄 **Gateway** → Acts as an entry/exit point between different networks.  
- 📡 **Load Balancer** → Distributes network traffic across multiple servers.

## 🖧 Components of a Network
A **network** connects multiple devices for communication.  

- 🖥️ **Hosts** → Computers, servers, IoT devices.  
- 🔀 **Switches** → Manage communication within LANs.  
- 📡 **Routers** → Connect different networks.  
- 🛡️ **Firewalls** → Protect against threats.  
- 📡 **Access Points** → Provide wireless access.  
- 🧭 **Protocols** → TCP/IP, HTTP, DNS, DHCP, FTP, SMTP.  
- 🌐 **Internet** → The global network of interconnected devices.

## 🚀 Summary
- 🖥️ **Computer** = Hardware + Software working together.  
- 🧩 **Web Server** = Hardware + OS + Web Software + Database.  
- 🖧 **Networking Devices** = Router, Switch, Hub, Firewall, Modem, Access Point.  
- 🌍 **Network** = The connection of devices using protocols for communication.
